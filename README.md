# Nuclear Physics Excitation Level Scheme Drawer

## This is my very first project. It is an elementary Python program intended to help physicists draw nuclear excitation-level schemes.

The program requires two inputs **.csv** files:
The first one is the **transitions** file that needs to be filled as follow *(Transition_energy, Starting_level, Ending_level)*
The second one is the **levels** file that needs to be filled as follow *(Level_energy, Spin_Parity)*
